Bootstrap Icons (v1.7.1)  

SOURCE: [icons.getbootstrap.com](https://icons.getbootstrap.com)  

I was having trouble with the jsdelivr version on their official site (due to adblocker and VPN issues), so I reuploaded the `.css` and `.woff2` files over here.  
I have no intent of claiming these as my own, I just wanted an alternate way to use them in my online project.
